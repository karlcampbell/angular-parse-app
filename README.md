An exploration of AngularJS and Parse.com

This is the first little app that I've build with AngularJS and Parse.com as a backend service. It's a simple "activity log" that allows you to create posts tagged with dates and tags. 

I found learning Angular with very little JS knowledge quite difficult. Things are moving so quickly, even SO questions from a year ago are obsolete. Anyway, I'm hoping this will help others who are just diving into the JS framework realm like I was a few months ago. 

Features:

- Parse.com integration
-   User registration/login
-   Private user data
-   Class relations
-   ACL implementation
- Sample directive using non-angular JS plugins (WYSIWYG editor)
- Access rights to routes
- Other things that I found useful to learn that I can't think of right now
